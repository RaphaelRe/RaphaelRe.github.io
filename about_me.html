	<h2>About me </h2>	
	<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE) Munich. My research activities are mostly about Bayesian statistics and modelling uncertainty. See Research for more information.</p>

	<p> Since I have a strong economic backround I am a little bit interested in (financial) econometrics and time series analysis </p>
	<p> If you don't find me in front of a computer I am probably in the Dojang - the place where I train traditional Tae-Kwon-Do. Sometimes you can also find me in a climbing hall or in the mountains hicking or on a snowboard. </p>
	<p>Next to my computer you will find some instruments which are dedicated to play irish folk (Bodhran, Tin- and Low-whistle and a Guitar). Everythin not on a pro level, but I get better...</p>
